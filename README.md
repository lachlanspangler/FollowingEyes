# FollowingEyes
# Description
This exercise focused on coding an additional eye to our screen that would follow the cursor of the user. Specifically, for this exercise I had to add a second "eye" element, and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using mouse events. With mouse events being a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events, such as click, mousemove, & mouseleave.

# Instalation
Download all the files and open index.html. Move your mouse and both eyes should follow the cursor.

# Usage
Educational purpose for myself, experimenting and finding what I can do.

# Roadmap
I'm thinking of seeing where this can take me, as this is one of the exercises I have loved the most. Especially the end project. My next feat should be a blank page with each click of the cursor, an appears where the cursor is clicked that follows its movements. Utilizing once again what I have learnt from this exercise but to a further extent.
